The "Focus Shield" auto-response happens inside Slack, not in the web UI.

To test this for the demo:

Open a Terminal and run the bot script:
bash
python focus_bot.py
(It should say "🛡️ Focus Shield Active. Waiting for DMs...")
Open Slack (on your phone or another window).
Send a DM to your bot user (the one you created) with the text:
"Hey quick question"

Watch Slack: The bot will immediately reply with:
"David is heads-down until 2pm. I can clarify or route this in the meantime."

For the Recording: You will record your Slack window for this specific scene (0:45), showing the message coming in and the bot auto-replying. Then you cut back to the web UI for the "Trust Ledger" part.
