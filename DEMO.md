# ⭐ YC DEMO SCRIPT (FINAL VERSION)

**Title:** “From 200 Messages → 12 Decisions”
**Runtime:** ~2 minutes 20 seconds

---

## 🎬 0:00 — Cold Open (Slack Chaos)

**[Screen Recording: Slack open with 150+ unread messages across 20 channels. High-stakes content.]**

**Founder VO (calm, tired, honest):**
> “Every morning, I used to open Slack to 150… sometimes 250 unread messages across two dozen channels.
> Sam Altman described this perfectly:
> ‘I dread the first hour of my day — it’s just an explosion of Slack.’
> I felt the same… until we built this.”

**[Hard cut.]**

---

## 🎬 0:12 — Reveal Focus OS (The Magic Cut)

**[Show the Focus OS web app, clean like Linear/Superhuman.]**

**Founder VO:**
> “Now I don’t start my day in Slack at all.
>
> I start it here — in Focus OS.
> Instead of 200 messages…
> I see 12 decisions.”

**[Scroll slowly:]**
*   Decisions (4)
*   Tasks (5)
*   FYIs (9)
*   Noise filtered (127)

**[Hover on “Noise filtered: 127.” Tooltip pops immediately.]**

**Founder VO (slightly relieved):**
> “One hundred twenty-seven messages are auto-filtered as noise — safely.”

**[Let that number land.]**

---

## 🎬 0:28 — The OS Primitive (Work Objects)

**[Click a Decision.]**

**[Show the Work Object:]**
*   Summary
*   Recommended action
*   Participants
*   Priority
*   Confidence score
*   Policy matches
*   Action items (if any)

**Founder VO:**
> “Focus OS converts Slack threads into structured Work Objects.
>
> Instead of reading long conversations, I just see the decision:
> the context, the tradeoffs, and the recommended action.”

**[Pause 1 second. Let the simplicity sink in.]**

---

## 🎬 0:45 — Drafting + Policy Learning (The “It Learns Me” Moment)

**[Open a draft response.]**

**Draft text example:**
> “Let’s move forward with Option B — it resolves the blocker and keeps Friday’s deadline.”

**Founder VO:**
> “It drafts my responses in my tone.
> I can approve… edit… or reject.”

**[Make a small edit to tone.]**

**[Inline prompt appears:]**
> “Apply this tone to future messages from @Investor?”
> ✔ Yes ✖ No

**[Click Yes immediately.]**

**Founder VO:**
> “Every correction becomes a rule — instantly.
> I don’t configure anything.
> Focus OS learns how I think.”

*(Note: This is your personalization moat. YC reviewers LOVE this moment.)*

## 🎬 1:03 — The Trust Ledger (The Objection Killer)

**[Open the Safety Ledger.]**

**[Show:]**
*   Draft generated
*   Noise filtered
*   Rule applied
*   Decision escalated
*   Auto-responses
*   Confidence scores
*   Rationale snippets

**Founder VO:**
> “The part that makes this trustworthy is the Safety Ledger.
> Every action the assistant takes is logged — with a clear explanation.
>
> No black box.
> No hallucinations.
> Nothing hidden.”

**[Click “Daily Digest”:]**
> “142 messages handled today.
> 5 decisions waiting.
> 0 critical misses.”

**Founder VO:**
> “This is why I rely on it.”

## 🎬 1:25 — Focus Shield (Deep Work Restored)

**[Trigger a Slack message from another device:]**
> “Hey quick question — can you review this?”

**[Show Focus OS auto-responding:]**
> “David is heads-down until 2pm.
> I can clarify or route this in the meantime.”

**Founder VO:**
> “During deep work, Focus OS shields me.
> It responds politely, at human timing, without pretending to be me.”

*(Note: This shows ethics, intelligence, and social correctness.)*

---

## 🎬 1:42 — Return to Calm (The Relief Moment)

**[Go back to the Daily Briefing.]**

**[Let the screen breathe — clean UI, lots of whitespace.]**

**Founder VO:**
> “Slack used to break my mornings.
> Now I don’t open it at all.
>
> Focus OS gives me a clean, structured, prioritized view of my day,
> learns my judgment automatically,
> protects my attention,
> and guarantees I never miss anything important.”

**[Pause.]**

## 🎬 2:00 — Closer (The Inevitability Line)

**Founder VO (quiet, confident):**
> “This is what communication feels like
> when the cognitive load disappears.”

**[Fade out.]**
